Description
This tool processes text files from the Libraries folder (e.g., english.txt), which define custom characters for Minecraft signs. It generates Stendhal mod-compatible files based on your input text, splitting it into multiple files if needed (2-6 characters per sign). These files must be manually placed in minecraft/config/stendhal/signs/ to use them in-game.

Usage Instructions
Run the program and enter your desired text (python main.py).
Pick the option you like.
The program creates a folder with files named cyberpunked_<YOUR_TEXT>_<NUMBER>.txt in Results/.
Copy these files to minecraft/config/stendhal/signs/.

In-Game Setup:
Place a sign and start editing.
Click Load from Disk â†’ Select the generated file (e.g., cyberpunked_HELLO_1).
Close the menu (click X), then edit the sign again and click Paste Sign.
Repeat for additional files if your text spans multiple signs.
Finalize: Apply glow ink and a dye (e.g., red) to the sign.

Notes
Each sign holds 2-6 characters. Longer text will generate multiple files.
Edit the Libraries files to change character designs (e.g., adjust ASCII art, standard width of 3 squares or 6 spaces).
I wrote the libraries in Notepad with Lucida Console Regular 10 font, so there is only 1 space between the squares. On the output they become 2, so everything will be even in Minecraft as well.

Recommendations:
Use dark signs on Black concrete behind Tinted glass for best results.
Tested on Minecraft 1.21.4 with Stendhal Mod 1.4.1-1.21.2.
